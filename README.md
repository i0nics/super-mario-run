<h1 align='center' >Super Mario Run</h1>
<p align='center'>A fun side-scrolling platformer written in Java based on the original Super Mario Run game for iOS!</p>

This project is based on the original 2016 Super Mario Run mobile game developed by Nintendo for iOS.
Super Mario Run is a side-scrolling platformer which consists of three levels. The player controls Mario or other characters 
as they automatically run across the screen while timing jumps to kill enemies, dodge environmental obstacles, and collect
coins to purchase new characters or power ups. This game also consists of a developer mode which was created with the intention
of making it easier for us to determine object placement coordinates while creating a new level.
