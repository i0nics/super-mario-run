 * extend from GraphicsPane and implement
 * as little or as much of the mouse listeners that you need
 * for your own programs.  Notice however that in this situation
 * There is no access to the GraphicsProgram window.
 * Make sure to distinguish between your constructor
 * and using showContents and hideContents
